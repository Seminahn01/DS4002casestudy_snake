The Snake Species ID data is too large to upload to GitHub. Therefore, this document contains a link to the dataset which is hosted on Google Drive. Anyone with the link should have access to the folders.

The data is pre-split into Train, Valid, and Test folders with JSON annotations for those images found within each folder. All of these items should be accessible through the link.
