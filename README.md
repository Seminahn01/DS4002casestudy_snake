# Snake Species Classification Case Study

Welcome to the official repository for the **Snake Species Classification** case study, developed as part of DS 4002 at the University of Virginia. This project places you in the role of a data scientist working with wildlife safety organizations to help identify local snake species from photos submitted by residents in the DMV area (DC, Maryland, Virginia).

Second-year students will walk through the full pipeline of building a computer vision model — from raw image data to a trained classifier — while learning about real-world constraints like limited data and inter-class similarity.

## Case Study Objectives

- Reorganize and preprocess real-world image data
- Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Evaluate the model using standard classification metrics
- Propose improvements based on results
